Potential methods of scraping the data:
- using reddit api
- ~~using requests & beautiful soup to get data in html format~~
- ~~using json links to get data in json format~~

Potential roadblocks:
- using reddit api; can't scrape all the thread titles? (stops after a certain point)
- figuring out how to get the comments

PRAW Documentation to Read:
- Working with PRAW's Models: Submission
- Working with PRAW's Models: Subreddit

What we plan to do before next meeting:
- read the docs
