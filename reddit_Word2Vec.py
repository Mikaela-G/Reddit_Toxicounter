# we're making two types of models:
#   3 part classification models that predict toxicity label from word embeddings (and nothing else)
#       3 potential labels:
#           very toxic -> >70% toxic_score and >70% severe_toxicity
#           moderately toxic -> <70% & >50% toxic_score and <70% & >50% severe_toxicity
#           not toxic -> <50% toxic_score
#           (see if there's any cases where there's <50% toxic_score but it's also severely toxic)
#       algorithms we can use:
#           Naive Bayes Classifier 
#           Logistic Regression
#           Random Forest
#           SVM
#           Recurrent Neural Network
#           Nearest Neighbor
#   regression models that analyze the interaction between toxic_label, time, and score

# things we need to do before modeling:
#   create 2 new columns: severe_toxicity, toxic_label
#       (toxicity_label will be our new ground truth)
#   create word embeddings using Word2Vec

# for the first type of model:
#   input for the main model = word embeddings
#   output for the main model = toxicity label
# for the second type of model:
#   exploring the relationships between the predictors and dependent variable
#   dependent variable can be toxicity_label, if we want to see how time and score impact toxicity

# stuff for visualization rather than modeling:
#   relationship between time and toxicity_label
#   relationship between time and score
